# Ros-Cart job task (React Dev)

Not participated, but wanna try anyway. 3h time olnly.
It took me a bit more time to finish...
It is a 'very-fast-coding' task anyway. No time to hesitate, so code looks like it looks 😇
The task part was React only. Node server added for fun and practice.

## Description

-   react & redux required
-   clean code required 🤐
-   create store page based on test api 🛍️
-   store data in locarStorate to prevent cart data lose
-   'add to cart' functionality
-   create cart with increase/decrease funcionality 🛒
-   when product amount reaches 0, remove product from cart

## How to

-   clone repo
-   `cd ros-cart/server`
-   `npm install`
-   `npm start`

then

-   `cd ros-cart/client`
-   `npm install`
-   `npm start`

or if you prefer run it at once with concurrently

-   install dependencies in client and server directories
-   cd `~/ros-cart`
-   run `npm run dev` (concurrently)
